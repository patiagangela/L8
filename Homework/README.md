# Homework #JSV

## Instructions

---

1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

   - `prototype`
     Can set methods on class by accessing and inheriting it.
   - Constructors
     Is a more efficient way to create many objects with the same properties. This is used when you want to store the same type of things like a "username", you don't want to repeat your code over and over again to list all usernames so you can use constructors.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L8/Homework/tests/JSV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
